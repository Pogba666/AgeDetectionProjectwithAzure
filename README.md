# AgeDetectionProjectwithAzure
This is a repository which was done as part of HPE workshop on Applied Deep Learning organized by Corporate Gurukul.

The project statement deals with classfying images into classes like Male Adult, Female Adult, Other Adults and Children.

The whole project involves creating a unique and new dataset, augmenting the images, making a suitable model to train on the images, Hyperparameter optimization and Deployment.

The project used basic Deep learning lybraries like Python and Tensorflow. On top of this, the project also involves the use of Azure for speeding up the training of models, storage of images in a blob and deployment of the model as a REST API.
